            <p id="me">I am thinking of creating and designing an application called <strong>"IntApp."</strong>
            <strong>IntApp</strong> is an application that, when successfully excuted will act as a translator.
        I am thinking of creating this application due to an increasing number of people with hearing impairment.
    It is extremely expensive for one to have a personal full time sign language interpreter. So by creating this application, 
am very sure it will be of much help to the hard of hearing in terms of easing communication.</p>
